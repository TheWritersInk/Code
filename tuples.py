# Difference between list and tuple
# Lists are amendable ~ You can change it
# Tuples are no ~ They are used for data that never changes
# An example of a tuple might be the range of the days of the week
# Later, you'll learn about inserting user input, like a full name, into a tuple
# that is used to identify an account, for example()
